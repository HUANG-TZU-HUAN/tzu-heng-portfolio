        <h2>Research Motivation and Direction</h2>
        <p class="intro" style="margin-top: 0;">
          I am currently an exchange student at the University of the West. I am interested in
          interdisciplinary research directions such as brain-computer interfaces for pain and emotion
          regulation, and I hope to contribute to practical work that supports human well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          My undergraduate research focuses on reducing hallucination in large language models through
          Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In my completed NSTC undergraduate project on diabetes
          health education, I designed and built the project database, then transformed complex
          unstructured data into a unified structured format for reliable retrieval and generation.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          At this stage, HCAI, HCI, and BCI are future goals rather than areas where I already have
          deep specialization. While I do not yet fully understand the biological mechanisms at the
          neuron level, I have strong data extraction and engineering capabilities. I can help a lab
          build automated literature retrieval systems, process large experimental metadata, and use AI
          tools to improve research workflows. I am also interested in psychology; I completed a
          general psychology course in university and received a score of 90.
