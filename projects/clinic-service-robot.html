        <p class="intro" style="margin-top: 0;">
          During my internship at Smart Healthcare Technology, Inc., our intern team co-developed an
          AI-powered clinic customer service system for Cheng Hsin General Hospital (CHGH,
          振興醫院). The project aimed to improve clinic efficiency and patient experience through a
          practical conversational service workflow.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          The system was built with Botpress and integrated with the company's next-generation clinic
          cloud APIs. The implementation included OAuth-based authentication, API integration for core
          clinic services, and JavaScript-based data processing modules. It supports key services
          including appointment booking, cancellation, queue and visit-progress checking, registration
          status checking, symptom inquiry, doctor schedule lookup, and FAQ support.
        </p>

              model support for intent understanding.
