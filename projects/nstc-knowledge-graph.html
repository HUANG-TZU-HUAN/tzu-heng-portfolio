        <p class="intro" style="margin-top: 0;">
          The Chronic Disease Health-Education Knowledge Graph Construction System is a diabetes-focused
          research project aimed at building a standardized and automatable workflow that transforms
          scattered online chronic disease education information into a structured knowledge graph.
          The system first collects public health-education data through web scraping, then applies
          automated text recognition and large language models to extract entities (such as diseases,
          symptoms, and treatment methods), relations, and attributes. The extracted results are
          organized into a graph data structure that can be stored in Neo4j.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          To improve reliability, the project uses prompt engineering and validation mechanisms to
          reduce hallucination risk in large language model outputs, improving knowledge accuracy and
          consistency. The final knowledge graph is integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
          (RAG) for health-education question answering, providing more reliable and contextual
          responses and serving as a foundation for future chronic disease digital health and smart
          healthcare applications.
